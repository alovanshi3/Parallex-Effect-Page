# Parallex_Effect_Page
This project demonstrates how to create a parallax scrolling effect using HTML and CSS. Parallax scrolling is a technique that creates an illusion of depth by having the background content or images move slower than the foreground content as the user scrolls down the page. This effect enhances the user experience by providing a more dynamic and visually appealing interface.

Overview
Initially, web pages with fixed position backgrounds allowed content to scroll independently past a static image. However, modern user interfaces have evolved to use parallax scrolling, creating a 3D depth effect where different elements scroll at different speeds. This approach adds a sense of immersion and dimension to web pages, making them more engaging and interactive.

<b>Features<b>
Multiple Layers: The implementation includes multiple layers of backgrounds that move at different speeds, simulating depth.
Smooth Scrolling: CSS properties are used to ensure smooth and visually appealing scrolling transitions.
